# Composition vs. Inheritance in JavaScript
## Introduction
Composition and inheritance are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) that enable code reuse and structuring. Both techniques facilitate the creation of complex software systems by promoting modularity and maintainability. In JavaScript, understanding the differences 
between composition and inheritance is crucial for designing effective and flexible codebases.

## Composition
Composition is a design principle that focuses on building complex objects by combining simpler, self-contained components. It emphasizes the creation of objects through the assembly of parts, where each part encapsulates specific functionality. Composition encourages the reuse of existing code by allowing objects to be constructed from a combination of other objects.

## Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass or base class). It establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes, where a subclass inherits characteristics from its superclass. Inheritance can promote code reuse, but it can also lead to tight coupling and inflexibility.

## Differences between Composition and Inheritance
- Flexibility: Composition allows more flexible construction of objects by combining components, enabling greater customization. Inheritance defines a fixed hierarchy and can be less flexible when adapting to changing requirements.

- Code Reuse: Composition promotes code reuse by assembling existing components. Inheritance also promotes code reuse, but it can lead to less modular code and potential duplication.

- Coupling: Composition typically results in looser coupling between components, as each part can be designed independently. Inheritance can lead to tighter coupling, as changes in the superclass can affect subclasses.

- Complexity: Composition is often favored for managing complexity and avoiding deep class hierarchies. Inheritance can lead to deep hierarchies that are harder to manage.


## Conclusion
Composition and inheritance are both valuable tools in JavaScript, each with its own strengths and use cases. Composition emphasizes building objects from smaller parts, promoting modularity and flexibility. Inheritance establishes "is-a" relationships between classes, enabling code reuse but potentially introducing tight coupling. Choosing between composition and inheritance depends on the specific design goals and requirements of your application. By understanding the differences and trade-offs, you can make informed decisions to create well-structured and maintainable code.
